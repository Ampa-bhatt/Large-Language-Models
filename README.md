Tech Stack

Framework: LangChain

Database: SQLite (Vector Database)

Interface: Gradio

Libraries/Tools:

PyTorch

sqlite3

OpenAI API (ChatGPT)

How It Works

PDF Input: Users upload PDFs containing FAQs or other commercial documents.

Text Processing: LangChain processes the text, storing it in SQLite as vector embeddings.

Query Execution: Using the OpenAI API, the system matches user queries with stored vectors to retrieve relevant answers.

Gradio Interface: Provides an intuitive UI for uploading documents, entering queries, and viewing results.

Usage

Upload Documents: Upload PDFs containing FAQs or other commercial documents.

Search Queries: Use the Gradio interface to type queries and retrieve relevant information.

Future Improvements

Add support for additional file formats (e.g., Word, Excel).

Integrate advanced search filters for more granular queries.

Implement multi-language support for documents.
